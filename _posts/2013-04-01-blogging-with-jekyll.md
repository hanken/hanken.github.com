Since I read that blogs are so 2004, I figured I finally need one too. A couple months ago I stumpled upon Jekyll - a static site generator. It is very easy once you've learned the basic concepts and it fits perfectly for github pages, which is just too awesome. The power of git and the simplicity of markdown makes for a brilliant combo.

I started with the repo of <a href="http://stephan83.github.com/">Stephan Florquin</a> who also crafted this nice layout. It's just a bunch of templates, posts are written in Markdown. Since it's database-less, you can store everything in git. Create a repo on github called username.github.com. Everytime you push to you're repo the sites gets freshly generated and thus updated with the newest post.
